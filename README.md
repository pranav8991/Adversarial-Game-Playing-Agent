# Adversarial-Game-Playing-Agent
In this project, we will build an agent to play Knights Isolation using adversarial search techniques. Unlike the standard Isolation game, where players control tokens that move like chess queens, this version features tokens that move in an L-shape, similar to knights in chess.
